Remote Features and TODO's list can be found at: http://goo.gl/L1C6X

Updating QDoc (assuming QtSDK is installed, and Qt 4.7.1 used. Change the link if needed):
 - QWebService: run from project's root: ~/QtSDK/Desktop/Qt/471/gcc/bin/qdoc3 ./QWebService/qwebservice.qdocconf
 - Converter:   run from project's root: ~/QtSDK/Desktop/Qt/471/gcc/bin/qdoc3 ./qtWsdlConverter/qtwsdlconverter.qdocconf

Example arguments for converter:
 --force --asynchronous --scons --cmake --json ../examples/wsdl/band_ws.asmx
 -af --cmake --scons --json ../examples/wsdl/band_ws.asmx

 - added tabulation length choice for converter (temporarily internal, will make a flag soon).

06.10.2011 19:14 CEST:
 - updated converter's help message,
 - updated README with example converter's usage,
 - updated converter's web method code generation, to reflect recent changes in QWebService,
 - changed converter's target to qtwsdlconvert (was qtWsdlConvert),
 - changed QWebMethod::sendMessage() to QWebMethod::invokeMethod(),
 - reverted private headers back to custom structure, as there were errors raised by Qt4.7 (and release libs in general).

26.09.2011 10:34 CEST:
 - make private headers inherit from QObjectPrivate, instead of
   relying on a custom structure,

21.09.2011 18:53 CEST:
 - make lines in code wrap at around 80 characters,
 - remove \fn declarations from QDoc comments,
 - make the “else” be on the same line as the closing brace of the previous if-branch,
 - begin enum constants with uppercase letter, and not make them all-uppercase,
 - make QObject-derived classes have the QObject *parent parameter as last one,
 - added some "clean" constructors to QWebMethod and QWebServiceMethod
   (they take in one parameter - QObject *parent = 0),
 - add copyright headers and the license for the files,
 - optimise QWebMethod setters and it's use of QString,
 - pass QString / QByteArray / etc. by const-ref,
 - use QLatin1String instead of QString::fromLatin1(“”),
 - fix strings initialisations and handling,
 - move all private and protected members to private headers,
 - added new methods to QWebService:
    - name(),
    - setName(),
    - method(),
    - methods(),
 - updated and expanded documentation,
 - rewritten headers and sources to reflect Qt coding style in getters/ setters
   declaration (methods are now grouped into getter-setter pairs. Previously,
   there was a big group of getters followed by another big group of setters),
 - marked v0.5.0.

13.09.2011 12:33 CEST:
 - added QWebService::removeMethod(), which deletes a web method specified by it's name,
 - added some QDoc descriptions to QWebService,

   as well as constructors),
 - marked v0.4.3.

12.09.2011 11:48 CEST:
 - added possibility to add methods custom to QWebService (not by using WSDL),
 - changed QString-based constructor of QWebService to accept not only WSDL files,
 - changed 'message' being used in code to describe methods into 'method'. It was a remnant of
   QSoapMessage, and could lead to confusion,

08.09.2011 18:45 CEST:
 - added QStringBuilder compatibility,
 - fixed some error state omissions in QWsdl (enterErrorState() was not being used where applicable),

 - added QWebMethod::replyReadParsed(), returning QVariant,
 - changed QWebServiceMethod::sendMessage() to return QByteArray.

04.09.2011 12:28 CEST:
 - moved authentication into public method - authenticate(). Cleaned the QWebMethod a bit. Algorithm still needs some tweaks,
   especially making auth less synchronous, but it looks much better than before,
 - updated docs,
 - updated reply parsing (a bit),
 - simplified QtDevNetEx, made it use nicieties of QWebMethod and also made it parse the reply (well, partially),
 - added new constructor to QWebMethod (like a standard one + QUrl. Saves one line of code for quick, parameterless methods),
 - added possibility to provide custom authentication data to QWebMethod::authenticate().

 - updated QWebMethod authentication to be more general,
 - expanded QtDevNetExample to read profile and posts (text only, for now),

03.09.2011 20:32 CEST:
 - modified gitignore to block all Qt Creator pro files,
 - added authentication to QWebMethod (username/ password + setters and getters. Also, a slot that
   attempts to authenticate automatically),
 - added more QDoc descriptions to QWebMethod,
 - rearranged 'examples' directory to cater for example applications, that are to be written,
 - added QtDevNetExample,
 - this commit BARELY WORKS, it has some nasty hard-coded things put in purely to make QtDevNetExample work.
   For hacking and usage v0.4.1 should be used. I will update the code soon.

31.08.2011 17:02 CEST:
 - added float/ double and general ArrayOf recognition to QWsdl,

 - added body to TestQWebMethod::asynchronousSendingTest(),
 - added QWebMethod::setMethodName(QString) method as a convenient synonim to ::setMessageName(QString),

   in examles/ dir,
 - added QWebService test "gettersTest" and "settersTest",
 - added QWsdl basic test,
 - various other small changes to the test suite.

25.08.2011 15:40 CEST:
 - small updates to tests and to QWebService library,
 - fixes in QUrl and message name usages,
 - removed networkReply from QWebMethod (it was segfaulting QWebMethod, and was not actually
   being used),
 - fixes and optimisations in both QWebMethod and QWebServiceMethod,
 - fixed QWebMethod::sendMessage(QByteArray) not working properly (check for byte array contents was wrong),
 - prepared working synchronous and asynchronous tests of QWebServiceMethod,
 - fixed (workaround) for some strange bug preventing qtWsdlConverter from compiling (it stated, that QWebServiceReader
   definition was wrong (missing class name), even though QWebService compiled flawlessly, and was used by test suite 
   without any problems).

22.08.2011 : CEST:
 - changed tests directory structure,
 - made the tests initially compilable - they check for errors after object construction.
   QWebMethod is acting strangely - it passes the test only when created as a pointer,
 - added error handling to QWebMethod,
 - updated error handling in QWsdl,
 - updated error handling in QWebMethod.

20.08.2011 13:37 CEST:
 - changed includes to be more specific (.h files, instead of whole modules),
 - added REST support to non-subclassed generated code.

20.08.2011 10:41 CEST:
 - made QWebMethod more abstract and subclass-friendly. The generic functionality (sending messages,
   complicated constructors) was moved to previously unused QWebServiceMethod class,
 - changed default sendMessage() to sendMessage(QByteArray = 0). When nothing is passed, it works as before (sends
   message using QMap parameters and options and httpMethod). When given a non-null QByteArray, it uses that array
   as message body (message header and httpMethod remain unaffected),
 - updated the whole project to reflect recent changes (changed QWebMethod to QWebServiceMethod where it was used, updated QDoc
   and README),
 - fixed (converter) Flags class not inheriting from QObject. Added operator=() to Flags,
 - marked v0.4.0.

20.08.2011 08:46 CEST:
 - added option for converter to subclass QWebMethod (--subclass switch), instead of writing entirely
   separate code (huge changes in converter's source),
 - added MessageGenerator class, moved message generation from CodeGenerator, and added subclass generation,

 - fixed messageName not being used properly in REST,
 - added more description to QWebMethod's QDoc,
 - added 'xml' and 'rest' options to converter,
 - added HttpMethod enum, it's setter (plus a QString setter), getter, a convenience httpMethodString() function,
   and it's QDoc to Flags class,
 - added protocolString() to Flags - a convenience function returning QString representation of protocol being used,
 - added 'xml' and 'rest' switches parsing to WsdlConverter,
 - simplified CodeGenerator's code a bit by using new convenience methods from Flags,
 - made HttpMethod just a QEnum, not a QFlag,
 - removed Q_ENUMS macro from enums that serve as QFlags,

 - changed licence to LGPL 2.1,
 - created online version of Features & TODO list - http://goo.gl/L1C6X,
 - optimised handling of --help flag in converter,
 - changed populateArgumentsList() into parseArguments() in wsdlconverter.cpp, as it better reflects it's current function,

 - removed QString host from QWebMethod. Internally, everything is handled purely by QUrl hostUrl now.
   Public API remained unchanged,
 - changed QWebService lib version to 0.3.1 to mark recent changes,

 - Flags class has been greatly expanded by new convenience methods,
 - Flags's QDoc has been updated to reflect the changes.

06.08.2011 : CEST:
 - another file reorganisation (separated tests from QWebService),
 - adjusted QWebService default library generation,
 - made converter and tests use the library (needs specification of LD_LIBRARY_PATH on runtime, though - at least in current setting). This has also simplified their .pro files,
 - added QWebService extensionless header - to ease including in other programs.

 - fixed qmake, webServiceName.cpp, headers and sources creation in converter (mostly small typos or omissions). They prevented created code from compiling,
 - in converter: (temporarily) made all messages return QString with exact server reply,
 - in converter: added creation of main.cpp (needed only for successful compilation of pure generated code. It's not needed if code is used for any purpose, as project would have it's own main.cpp in that case).

25.07.2011 19:06 CEST. Since 02d3b4ebddc61d60401255456834edc4f18daddf and earlier:
