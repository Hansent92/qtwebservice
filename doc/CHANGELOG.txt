Changelog for QWebService library project & qtWsdlConverter.
Part of the initial development is not expressed here. Refer to git logs or ask sierdzio at sierdzio@gmail.com

Updating QDoc (assuming QtSDK is installed, and Qt 4.7.1 used. Change the link if needed):
 - QWebService: run from project's root: ~/QtSDK/Desktop/Qt/471/gcc/bin/qdoc3 ./QWebService/qwebservice.qdocconf
 - Converter:   run from project's root: ~/QtSDK/Desktop/Qt/471/gcc/bin/qdoc3 ./qtWsdlConverter/qtwsdlconverter.qdocconf

14.08.2011 : CEST:
 - added getHost() to QWebMethod,
 - added getHostUrl() to QWebMethod,
 - added QDoc instructions to to of CHANGELOG,
 - added parametrization of generated methods' and objects' suffixes (default are "Msg" for objects, "Send" for sending methods). Suffixes are stored in Flags object. They can be specified by using new application switches: "--objSuffix=<var>" and "--msgSuffix=<var>",
 - removed QString host from QWebMethod. Internally, everything is handled purely by QUrl hostUrl now.
   Public API remained unchanged,
 - changed QWebService lib version to 0.3.1 to mark recent changes,
 - changed asynchronous 'if' statements in CodeGenerator - they are a bit more easy to read and universal,
 - changed names of created message objects, so that they are clearily distinct from class name (Msg suffix, by default),
 - updated QDoc, added some better class and enum descriptions to the project,
 - updated README with more descriptions of QWebService,
 - fixed some minor issues in code generation.

13.08.2011 13:22 CEST:
 - added some info to readme (part concerning QWebService),
 - renamed classes in QWebService (removed Abstract suffix, changed QSoapMessage into QWebMethod),
 - updated QDoc,
 - marked as v0.3.0.

10.08.2011 18:19 CEST:
 - made --no-build-system truly exclusive (in main, it is additionally checked in CodeGenerator),
 - made most other switches more strictly exclusive,
 - updated info about switches in README,
 - moved most of the code out ouf main.cpp (in Converter) into WsdlConverter,
 - QDoc documented the newly moved code,
 - changed Flags object to be one pointer throughout converter.

09.08.2011 : CEST:
 - fixed issues with CMake and SCons creation,
 - fixed protocol not being propagated properly to generated code,
 - made exclusive switches truly exclusive (they used to be turned on completely independently,
   which may have lead to potential problems),
 - added some comments to main.cpp in converter,
 - added qDebug warning to notify users about lacks in automatic SCons generation,
 - added OBJECTS_DIR var to all converter and test projects.

09.08.2011 12:06 CEST:
 - added 'soap' to Flags enum,
 - added initial implementation for --scons and --cmake.

09.08.2011 10:10 CEST:
 - changed 'hostname' to 'host' in all classes,
 - split setParams() into setParams() and setReturnValue() in QSoapMessage,
 - removed QMap retunVal from static sendMessage() and QSoapMessage constructor,
 - implemented recent changes to QSoapMessage into converter's code generation,
 - changed StandardPath to CodeGenerator.

08.08.2011 21:06 CEST:
 - added --all-in-one-dir-structure implementation,
 - fixed QSoapMessage SOAP 1.0 implementation,
 - removed QSoapMessage role enum,
 - changed QSoapMessage's enum to QFlag,
 - added 'soap' entry to QSoapMessage QFlag - it combines soap10 and soap12,
 - added initial HTTP support to QSoapMessage,
 - added initial JSON support to QSoapMessage,
 - updated QSoapMessage QDoc.

07.08.2011 13:02 CEST:
 - added some commentary to test cases,
 - added --json flag (meant to use JSON as communication protocol. Not implemented functionality, just the flag),
 - inverted the changelog (newest entries are now at the beginning),
 - changed the Flags class in converter. Now, it's made using Q_FLAGS, and various options can be combined using binary OR. All flags, including protocol, are now unified into one big enum,
 - Flags class has been greatly expanded by new convenience methods,
 - Flags's QDoc has been updated to reflect the changes.

06.08.2011 : CEST:
 - another file reorganisation (separated tests from QWebService),
 - adjusted QWebService default library generation,
 - made converter and tests use the library (needs specification of LD_LIBRARY_PATH on runtime, though - at least in current setting). This has also simplified their .pro files,
 - added QWebService extensionless header - to ease including in other programs.

31.07.2011 : CEST. Since 1f8d25287426c9142aabb782785385196d9217fc:
 - optimised conversion slightly (lowered amount of wsdl pointer uses),
 - added support for '--asynchronous' flag,
 - fixed idfefs in generated header files.

30.07.2011 13:26 CEST, v0.2.1:
 - reorganised folder structure, moved folders of converter and QWebService into project's root,
 - fixed qmake, webServiceName.cpp, headers and sources creation in converter (mostly small typos or omissions). They prevented created code from compiling,
 - in converter: (temporarily) made all messages return QString with exact server reply,
 - in converter: added creation of main.cpp (needed only for successful compilation of pure generated code. It's not needed if code is used for any purpose, as project would have it's own main.cpp in that case).

25.07.2011 19:06 CEST. Since 02d3b4ebddc61d60401255456834edc4f18daddf and earlier:
 - finished basic QDoc documentation of QWebService and qtWsdlConverter,
