TODO'S:
 - (QWsdl) implement more parameter types,
 - (converter) parametrise object and method names' suffixes (currently, they are Send for method, Msg for object),
 - (converter) prepare '--compact-mode' implementation,
 - (converter) review '--debug-mode' implementation - or delete it,
 - (converter) review protocol implementation,
 - (converter) (proposal) use more standard approach to command line reading,
 - (QWebService & converter) (proposal) replace '\r\n' in QSoapMessage and converted code with OS-independent code,
 - (QWebService & converter) (proposal) change returnValue to QVariant or QString (in QSoapMessage).


IDEAS:
Should messages (in converter) return QStrings (with text reply) or try to automatically extract relevant data?

When there is dir name conflict, app can ask for a new name, instead of exiting.

File creation may be template-based!
