Remote Features and TODO's list can be found at: http://goo.gl/L1C6X

TODO'S (done marked with *):
 - update and expand unit tests:
   - read details of code creation from WSDL converter
   - update getters and setters tests of QWebService, QWsdl, QWebMethod, QWebServiceMethod
 - add support for multiple replies (think SOAP ComplexType)
 - add QObject properties to QWebService classes, so that it is “properly” Qt
 - make use in QML easy (this has to be researched, maybe it is easy already - I simply don’t know yet)
 - parse JSON replies
 - (optional) provide QWsdl parsing based on QtXmlPatterns
 - update and expand QDoc
 - add video and text tutorials, how-tos etc

Done:
 - clean licence statements off unecessary things
 - parse XML replies
 - update SOAP message parsing
 - remove QWebServiceReader
 - update converter
 - change 'message' to 'method' in converter
 - make the code (QWsdl, converter) be based on QWebMethod, not QWebServiceMethod
