TODO'S:
qwebmethod.cpp:

Please wrap your lines at 80 or, at most, 100 characters.

Please add the copyright headers (copyright you, not Nokia) and the license for the files.

Please don’t use QString::fromLatin1(“”); Use QString(). And that’s if the string is set to something else — in the constructor, it was already properly initialised.

You don’t need \fn if the documentation is for the function that comes right after the documentation. Better leave it out.

QString / QByteArray / etc. must always be passed by const-ref. Change all functions that take a by-value QString to by-const-ref. Including in signals.

Please make the “else” be on the same line as the closing brace of the previous if-branch.

Do not write: if (newMethod.toLower() == QString::fromLatin1(“…”)). First of all, store the result of toLower() instead of calling it multiple times. Second, use QLatin1String, not QString::fromLatin1.

qwebmethod.h: 
Missing copyright and license header.

Enum constants must start with uppercase letter. Do not make them all-uppercase either.

QObject-derived classes should have the QObject *parent parameter last.

Qt coding style requires that there be no private or protected members. Please move all privates to the Private class.
