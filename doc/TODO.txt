TODO'S:
 - (converter) prevent main.cpp from accepting conflicting switches,
 - (converter) review asynchronous 'if' statements - in most, checks are probably too strict,
 - (converter) change names of created message objects, so that they are clearily distinct from class name,
 - (converter) prepare '--compact-mode' implementation,
 - (converter) review '--debug-mode' implementation - or delete it,
 - (converter) review protocol implementation,
 - (QWebService & converter) change 'hostname' to 'host' in all classes,
 - (QWebService & converter) replace '\r\n' in QSoapMessage and converted code with OS-independent code,
 - (QWebService & converter) change returnValue to QVariant or QString (in QSoapMessage),
 - (QWsdl) implement more parameter types.


IDEAS:
Should messages (in converter) return QStrings (with text reply) or try to automatically extract relevant data?
This should also be commented into the code.

When there is dir name conflict, app can ask for a new name, instead of exiting.

File creation may be template-based!

A re-think is needed to accomodate the 'compact' path, as well as role of 'protocol' in file creation
(IMO (sierdzio) - it should specify the default value in standard path, and the only one in compact).
