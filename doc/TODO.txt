TODO'S:
 - (converter) prepare '--asynchronous' part of <service>.cpp and <service>.h,
 - (converter) prepare '--all-in-one-dir' structure,
 - (converter) prepare '--compact-mode' implementation,
 - (converter) review '--debug-mode' implementation,
 - (converter) review protocol implementation.


IDEAS:
Should messages (in converter) return QStrings (with text reply) or try to automatically extract relevant data?
This should also be commented into the code.

When there is dir name conflict, app can ask for a new name, instead of exiting.

File creation may be template-based!

A re-think is needed to accomodate the 'compact' path, as well as role of 'protocol' in file creation
(IMO (sierdzio) - it should specify the default value in standard path, and the only one in compact).
