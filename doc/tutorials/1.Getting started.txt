This tutorial is a starting point for developers that want to use QtWebService toolkit. For a short introduction into what this project is all about, see ../README.txt. It will give you a small overview of available tools and libraries. Then, you can proceed to other tutorials based on your requirements.

This project also comes with a detailed (hopefully :) If not, don't hesitate to point any things you feel are done badly to sierdzio@gmail.com) QDoc documentation, available in project's sources and in ../html/ directory. Apart from that, you can take a look at examples (../../examples/), tests (../../tests/), and some video tutorials located in ../videos/.

The directory you are currently in should have some textual tutorials. Their aim is to show you how to use this toolkit.

That's it for this file, feel free to look around. Happy Qt hacking!

Cheers,
