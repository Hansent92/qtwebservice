Possible new flags:
 - set of switches that would result in different output code structure (different folders,
   maybe no messages, compact code, C++11 code etc.),
 - flags to change the build file creation (default is qmake, but maybe we can code some
   --scons, --cmake etc.).

When there is dir name conflict, app can ask for a new name, instead of exiting.

File creation may be template-based!

A re-think is needed to accomodate the 'compact' path, as well as role of 'protocol' in file creation
(IMO - sierdzio it should specify the default value in standard path, and the only one in compact).
